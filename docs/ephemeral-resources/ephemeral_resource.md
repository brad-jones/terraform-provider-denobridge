# denobridge_ephemeral_resource (Ephemeral Resource)

Bridges the terraform-plugin-framework Ephemeral Resource to a Deno HTTP Server.

## Example Usage

```terraform
ephemeral "denobridge_ephemeral_resource" "uuid" {
  # The path to the underlying deno script.
  # Remote HTTP URLs also supported! Any valid value that `deno serve` will accept.
  path = "${path.module}/ephemeral-resource.ts"

  # The inputs required by the underlying deno script to read the data.
  props = {
    type = "v4"
  }

  # Optionally provide a path to a deno config file.
  #
  # If none is given, the denobridge provider will attempt to locate the closest
  # config file relative to the script path. This is to ensure that things like
  # import maps work as expected.
  #
  # If you wish to opt out of this automatic config discovery, supply the path "/dev/null".
  config_file = "/path/to/deno.json"

  # Optionally set any runtime permissions that the deno script may require.
  permissions = {
    all = true # Maps to --allow-all (use with caution!)

    # Otherwise provide the exact permissions your script needs.
    # see: https://docs.deno.com/runtime/fundamentals/security/#permissions
    allow = ["read", "net=example.com:443"]
    deny = ["write"]
  }
}

resource "foo" "bar" {
  # The results are again untyped and dynamic based on the deno script returned
  # In this example we would receive a new UUID generated with crypto.randomUUID()
  id = ephemeral.denobridge_ephemeral_resource.uuid.result
}
```

## OpenAPI Specification

HTTP API contract for Terraform `denobridge_ephemeral_resource` implementations.

This specification defines the endpoints that a Deno TypeScript script must implement
to provide ephemeral resource functionality in Terraform.

Ephemeral resources are short-lived resources that exist only during a Terraform
operation (plan/apply). They are typically used for temporary credentials, tokens,
or other time-sensitive data. The provider will start your Deno script as an HTTP
server and manage the ephemeral resource lifecycle through these endpoints.

  /renew:
    post:
      summary: Renew the ephemeral resource (optional)
      description: |
        Optional endpoint to renew an ephemeral resource that may expire.

        This is called at the time specified by the renewAt value returned
        from /open or a previous /renew call. If this endpoint is not
        implemented (returns 404), the provider will not attempt to renew.

        the previous /renew call.

        Optional endpoint to clean up an ephemeral resource when it's no longer needed.

        This is called when the Terraform operation completes or when the resource
        is no longer referenced. If this endpoint is not implemented (returns 404),
        the provider will not attempt cleanup.

        The request body contains the private data returned from /open or
        the most recent /renew call.

## Example Server

This shows how one might fulfil the above OpenAPI specification.

The script **MUST** export a `default` export that satisfies `Deno.ServeDefaultExport`.
So that it can be executed with [`deno serve`](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/cli/serve/).

_NB: Using Hono is not a requirement, your welcome to use your favorite HTTP server library._

```ts
import { Hono } from "jsr:@hono/hono";

const app = new Hono();

app.get("/health", (c) => {
  return c.body(null, 204);
});

app.post("/open", async (c) => {
  const body = await c.req.json();
  const { type } = body.props;

  if (type !== "v4") {
    return c.json({ error: "Unsupported UUID type" }, 422);
  }

  return c.json(crypto.randomUUID());
});

export default app satisfies Deno.ServeDefaultExport;
```
